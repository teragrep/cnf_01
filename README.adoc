= Teragrep Configuration Library for Java

// Add a short description of your project. Tell what your project does and what it's used for.

CNF-01 is a library that provides immutable configuration for Java projects. Immutability is achieved by converting the configuration source into an immutable Map. The resulting configuration Map can't be altered even with modifying the underlying source.

== Features

// List your project's features
- Provides immutable configurations for:
. configuration files / path properties (`PathConfiguration`)
. System Properties (`PropertiesConfiguration`)
. environment variables (`EnvironmentConfiguration`)
. command line arguments (`ArgsConfiguration`)
- Default configurations in case the provided configurations from a source are not found or are otherwise broken (`DefaultConfiguration`)

== How to use

// add instructions how people can start to use your project
=== Configuration

All the sources are usable with the same `Configuration` -interface. It has a single function:

[,java]
----
Map<String, String> asMap() throws ConfigurationException;
----

=== System Properties

In Java, System properties can be utilized with `System.setProperty(key, value)`.

System properties can be used as a configuration source in CNF-01 with the `PropertiesConfiguration` object. It has two constructors:

[,java]
----
public PropertiesConfiguration(); // uses System.getProperties()
public PropertiesConfiguration(Properties properties); // uses any Java Properties given
----

Most likely the default constructor is what you'll need, but in some cases the second constructor might become handy.

Here's an example of using `PropertiesConfiguration`:

[,java]
----
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration(); // uses System.getProperties()
Map<String, String> result = config.asMap();
----

=== Configuration File

One of the supported configuration sources is a `File`. These are often marked with a ".properties" file extension but basically any Java's `File` object will do. The properties have to be given in a `key=value` format in the `File`. For example:

[,bash]
----
bar=foo
foo=bar
----

A file can be used as a configuration source with the `PathConfiguration` object. It has two constructors:

[,java]
----
public PathConfiguration(final String fileName); // Uses the filename
public PathConfiguration(final File file); // Uses Java's File object
----

Here's an example of using `PathConfiguration`:

[,java]
----
Configuration configuration = new PathConfiguration("file/path");
Map<String, String> configMap = new HashMap<>();
try {
    configMap = configuration.asMap();
} catch (ConfigurationException e) {
    // Handle the exception...
}
----

`PathConfiguration` throws an exception if the `File` is not found.

Read Default Configuration section to see how default configurations can be used to avert the need for the try-catch.

=== Command line arguments

Command line arguments (or any `String[] args`) can be utilized as a configuration source with the `ArgsConfiguration` object.

Here's an example of using `ArgsConfiguration`:

[,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Configuration configuration = new ArgsConfiguration(args);
    Map<String, String> configMap = new HashMap<>();
    try {
        configMap = configuration.asMap();
    } catch (ConfigurationException e) {
        // Handle the exception...
    }
}
----

`ArgsConfiguration` throws an exception if the Strings in the array don't follow the `key=value` format.

Read Default Configuration section to see how default configurations can be used to avert the need for the try-catch.

=== Environment Variables

`EnvironmentConfiguration` object supports Java's `System.getenv()`, meaning the system's environment variables. The constructor takes no arguments.

Here's an example of using `EnvironmentConfiguration`:

[,java]
----
Configuration configuration = new EnvironmentConfiguration();
Map<String, String> configMap = configuration.asMap();
----

=== Default configuration

Default configurations can be used in case the `asMap()` function throws `ConfigurationException`. If the function throws an exception, the defaults are used instead. Only `PathConfiguration` and `ArgsConfiguration` can currently throw an exception.

`DefaultConfiguration` follows the pattern of composable decorators introduced in Elegant Objects. Therefore, it takes another `Configuration` object as an argument in the constructor. The second argument is an `ImmutableMap` which is in the CNF-01 library as well.

Here's an example of how to use `DefaultConfiguration` when paired with `PathConfiguration`:

[,java]
----
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("foo", "bar");
ImmutableMap<String, String> defaults = new ImmutabilitySupportedMap<>(map).toImmutableMap();

DefaultConfiguration defaultConfiguration = new DefaultConfiguration(
    new PathConfiguration("invalid.path"), // uses PathConfiguration that will throw an exception
    defaults
);

Map<String, String> result = defaultConfiguration.asMap();
----

=== Configuration objects in your project

The configuration Map from CNF-01 shouldn't be used directly in regular objects. It should only be passed to objects that are responsible for providing configured versions of other objects, in other words, Factories. The regular objects must not be configurable!

Small example with an `Example` object:

[,java]
----
ExampleFactory exampleFactory = new ExampleFactory(configurationMap);
Example example = exampleFactory.example();
----

Here, the logic for instantiating an `Example` is in the `ExampleFactory` object, which receives the configuration map from CNF-01 as a parameter. This ensures that the main object `Example` is as clear as it can be.
